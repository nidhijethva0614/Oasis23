Oasis InfoByte Company Internship Program - Number Guessing Game
Welcome to the Oasis InfoByte Company Internship Program! This Java task is designed to test your programming skills and problem-solving abilities by creating a Number Guessing Game.

**Game Description**
The Number Guessing Game is a simple text-based game where the computer generates a random number between a specified range, and the player has to guess the correct number. The computer provides feedback on whether the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct. The player continues guessing until they guess the correct number or choose to quit the game.

Task Details
   Your task is to implement the Number Guessing Game in Java. The game should have the following features:

   The computer should generate a random number between a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).

   The player should be prompted to enter their guess.

   The game should provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

   If the player guesses correctly, the game should display a congratulatory message and show the number of attempts it took to guess correctly.

   The player should have the option to quit the game at any time by typing a specified keyword (e.g., "quit" or "exit").

   The game should handle invalid inputs from the player and provide appropriate error messages.

Getting Started
To get started with the task, follow these steps:

Fork this repository on GitHub. You'll find the starter code and instructions in the repository.

Oasis InfoByte Company Internship Program **- ATM Interface**
Welcome to the Oasis InfoByte Company Internship Program! This Java task is designed to assess your object-oriented programming skills and design abilities by creating an ATM Interface.

ATM Interface Description
The ATM Interface is a simple text-based application that simulates the basic functionality of an ATM (Automated Teller Machine). The interface should allow users to perform typical ATM operations, such as:

Displaying the account balance
Withdrawing funds
Depositing funds
Transfer
Quitting the ATM interface
Users should be able to log in to their account by providing a valid account number and PIN. Once logged in, they can perform the above operations.

Task Details
   Your task is to implement the ATM Interface in Java. The interface should have the following features:

   User Authentication: Users should be prompted to enter their account number and PIN to log in to their account.

   Account Balance: After logging in, users should be able to see their account balance.

   Withdrawal: Users should be able to withdraw funds from their account. The interface should check for sufficient funds and update the account balance accordingly.

   Deposit: Users should be able to deposit funds into their account. The interface should update the account balance accordingly.

  Quit: Users should be able to exit the ATM interface when they are done with their transactions.
 
   Error Handling: The interface should handle invalid inputs gracefully and display appropriate error messages.

Getting Started
To get started with the task, follow these steps:

Fork this repository on GitHub. You'll find the starter code and instructions in the repository.

Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone <URL of the forked repository>
Navigate to the project directory:
cd atm-interface
Open the project in your favorite Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.).

Implement the ATM Interface according to the task details mentioned above.

Test your implementation thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.

Commit your code and push it to your forked repository.

Create a pull request to submit your solution.

Evaluation
Your solution will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

Correctness and functionality of the implemented ATM Interface.

Code quality, including readability, documentation, and adherence to object-oriented programming principles.

Handling of edge cases and invalid inputs.

Efficient use of Java concepts, data structures, and design patterns.
